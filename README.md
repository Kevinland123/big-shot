# big-shot
This is the AP Comp Sci A class' first group project.

It's a game where the player has to shoot invading space ships before they crash into your cities/buildings. 
You have a single cannon which can rotate and shoot down the invaders.

It uses classes, arrays, matix translations & rotations
